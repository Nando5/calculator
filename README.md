# calculator
A simple calculator project i gave myself to practice my HTML, CSS and JS logic skills

Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, TweenMax; <br>
Duration: 1 day

This is an on-going project i gave myself to practice and track my development in programming. The basis is to just try to mimic a simple calculator's behaviour. All assets are my own and created in illustrator.

To give the site a little more life, i used TweenMax for the animations and button clicks. <br>

STILL TO DO: As this is on-going i am re-visiting my code progressively in order to refactor and add more efficient functionality as well as iron out bugs.
